# Calibrate a Germanium detector

- Find peaks in 152Eu source data `152Eu_lines.dat`
- Fit the peaks in `152Eu_lines.txt` using a gaussian with a background contribution
- extract the cetroids from each fit
- Bonus: create a calibration function for the Ge detector
    - i.e find Energy = f(channel)

first column is channel number, second column is counts
